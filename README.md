## Project Overview

The global economy experiences continuous fluctuations, impacting various facets of society, including employment opportunities and job security. In recent times, the economic downturn has raised concerns about its effects on the job market. The technology sector, once considered stable and ever-growing, has witnessed a significant rise in layoffs, prompting a reassessment of employment stability in the industry.

## Motivation
As international students pursuing careers in technology, we have faced significant challenges in securing internships despite persistent efforts. This firsthand experience reflects the growing difficulty of job hunting in the current climate. Even those who secure employment remain uncertain due to ongoing layoffs. Understanding the key factors affecting job stability is essential for job seekers and policymakers. This study aims to explore these influences and provide insights into navigating the evolving tech job market.
